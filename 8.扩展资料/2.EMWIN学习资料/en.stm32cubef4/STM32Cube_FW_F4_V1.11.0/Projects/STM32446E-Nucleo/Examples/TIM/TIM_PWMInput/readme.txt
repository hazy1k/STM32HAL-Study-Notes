@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency and 
duty cycle of an external signal.

The TIM1CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).
The SystemCoreClock is set to 180 MHz for STM32F446xx Devices.

TIM1 is configured in PWM Input Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM1 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency and the duty cycle, we use the TIM1 CC2 interrupt request,
so in the TIM1_CC_IRQHandler routine, the frequency and the duty cycle of the external 
signal are computed. 

The "uwFrequency" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock,
Frequency = TIM1 counter clock / TIM1_CCR2 in Hz, 

The "uwDutyCycle" variable contains the external signal duty cycle:
DutyCycle = (TIM1_CCR1*100)/(TIM1_CCR2) in %.

The minimum frequency value to measure is (TIM1 counter clock / CCR MAX)
                                         = (180 MHz)/ 65535
                                         = 2747 Hz

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The clock setting is configured to have the max product performance (max clock frequency) 
      so not optimized in term of power consumption.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F446xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F4xx-Nucleo rev C 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - For This example to work properly, a 2.2 �F Capacitor must be present on the board in slot C26.

  - STM32F4xx-Nucleo Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM1 CH2 pin PA.09 (pin 21 in CN10  
      connector)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
