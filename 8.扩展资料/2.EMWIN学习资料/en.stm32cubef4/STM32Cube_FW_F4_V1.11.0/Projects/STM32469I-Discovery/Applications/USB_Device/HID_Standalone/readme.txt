@par Application Description 

This application is a part of the USB Device Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to 
use USB device application based on the Human Interface (HID) on the STM32F469xx devices.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F469xx USB OTG Device peripheral where the STM32 MCU is
enumerated as a HID device using the native PC Host HID driver to which the STM32469I-Discovery
board is connected, in order to emulate the joystick by moving the host mouse pointer horizontally.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 180 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from a specific output of two PLLs PLL or PLL SAI.
In the High Speed (HS) mode the USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

The 48 MHz clock for the USB FS can be derived from one of the two following sources:
  � PLL clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLL as clock source, the PLL clock must be programmed
    to output 48 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLVCO/PLLQ).
  � PLLSAI clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLLSAI as clock source, the PLLSAI clock must be programmed
    to output 48 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLSAIVCO/PLLSAIP).
 
This application supports remote wakeup (which is the ability of a USB device to bring a suspended bus back
to the active condition), and the Key button is used as the remote wakeup source. 
   
By default, in Windows powered PC the Power Management feature of USB mouse devices is turned off.
This setting is different from classic PS/2 computer functionality. Therefore, to enable the Wake from 
standby option, user must manually turn on the Power Management feature for the USB mouse.

To manually enable the wake from standby option for the USB mouse, proceed as follows: 
 - Start "Device Manager",
 - Select "Mice and other pointing devices",
 - Select the "HID-compliant mouse" device (make sure that PID &VID are equal to 0x5710 & 0x0483 respectively) 
 - Right click and select "Properties", 
 - Select "Power Management" tab,
 - Finally click to select "Allow this device to wake the computer" check box.

The function GetPointerData() is responsible to move the mouse cursor automatically,
which can be easily customized (square, circle...). In this application the cursor
is moving forward and backward in an infinite loop.
 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
For more details about the STM32Cube USB Device library, please refer to UM1734 
"STM32Cube USB Device library".
      
@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PH7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F469xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32469I-Discovery 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32469I-Discovery Set-up
    - Connect the STM32469I-Discovery board to the PC through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cable to the connector: 
      - CN13: to use USB Full Speed (FS)

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
