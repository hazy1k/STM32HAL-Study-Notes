@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate three 
complementary TIM1 signals, to insert a defined dead time value, to use the break 
feature and to lock the desired parameters.

TIM1CLK is fixed to SystemCoreClock, the TIM1 Prescaler is set to have
TIM1 counter clock = 18MHz.

The objective is to generate PWM signal at 10 KHz:
  - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 10000) - 1

The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description: 
The channel 1 duty cycle is set to 50% so channel 1N is set to 50%.
The channel 2 duty cycle is set to 25% so channel 2N is set to 75%.
The channel 3 duty cycle is set to 12.5% so channel 3N is set to 87.5%.
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

A dead time equal to 11/SystemCoreClock is inserted between the different 
complementary signals, and the Lock level 1 is selected.
The break Polarity is used at High level.

The TIM1 waveforms can be displayed using an oscilloscope.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL RevB
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)  
      - TIM1_CH1N pin (PB.13)  
      - TIM1_CH2  pin (PE.11)  
      - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.14)  
      - TIM1_CH3  pin (PA.10)  
      - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.15)

    - Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PB.12) to the GND. To generate a 
      break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V.  


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
